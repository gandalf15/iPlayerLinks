# iplayerlinks
This is a small program written in Go that retrieves URLs of all episodes found on the given source URL from BBC iPlayer.
For example: https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/p075jwc2/numbersongs
You can Save links for a text file or download all episodes to a specified directory.
It was tested only on Pop OS 20.10 and I have no interest improving or working on it.
It is definatelly not optimised or nice code.

This was a small project to learn a bit more about [Fyne](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne).
